Given an array of integers and two numbers k1 and k2. Find the sum of all elements between given two k1’th and k2’th smallest elements of the array. It may  be assumed that all elements of array are distinct.

Example :
Input : arr[] = {20, 8, 22, 4, 12, 10, 14},  k1 = 3,  k2 = 6  
Output : 26          
         3rd smallest element is 10. 
         6th smallest element is 20. 
         Sum of all element between k1 & k2 is 12 + 14 = 26 . 



{20, 8, 22, 4, 12, 10, 14},  k1 = 3,  k2 = 6  




Step 1:
FInd k1th smallest ELment
FInd k2th smallest ELmeent 

then find elenents in the range k1 to k2 by traversing the array




Variation:


k1th smallest
k2th largest 

in between range


k1th largest and k2th largest....

anything like this


Also range can be inbetween the range k1 and k2  or not in range k1 and k2....
