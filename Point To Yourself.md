Just when you think you’re done with DSA prep,
you realize, you were only getting started.

Where easy problems end, the struggle with edge cases begins. Because solving a problem isn’t the same as solving it cleanly in 30 minutes, under pressure, while explaining out loud.

Where 100 problems feel like an achievement, you hit a real interview and freeze, because the pattern didn’t fit, and brute force wasn’t enough.

Where you feel confident with arrays and strings, a graph question reminds you how much you’ve avoided recursion Or how quickly your logic breaks without proper dry runs.

Where mock interviews give you hope, the real round shows you how shaky your fundamentals are when you can't explain time complexity under stress.

Where you think “I’ve covered everything,” you forget that companies aren’t testing your memory, they’re testing how you think when things don’t go as planned.

That’s the truth about coding interviews.

It’s not just about solving X problems. It’s about becoming someone who can break down any problem, even one you’ve never seen before.

That kind of confidence doesn’t come from shortcuts.
It comes from depth, discomfort, and repetition.

So what do you do?

▶️ Stop counting problems.
Solve fewer, but revisit them. Understand the “why,” not just the “how.”

▶️ Track your weak spots.
Every time you fail a problem, log it. Pattern? Mistake? Confusion? Go to the root of the problem Write it. Revisit it. Own it.

▶️ Practice under pressure.
Use a timer. Talk out loud. Simulate the interview.
You’re not just solving problems, you’re training your nervous system.

▶️ Give it 6-12 months.
Of real, deep work. Not passive scrolling. Not copying solutions.
The kind of prep that changes how you think, not just what you remember.

Your offer letter won’t come because you solved 300 questions.
It’ll come because you became someone who can build logic from scratch under fire.
