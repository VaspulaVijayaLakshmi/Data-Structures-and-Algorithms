//Lets ignore this condition for a sec

// For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they
// were present in nums is preserved.


// then we would have sorted the array first
// eg:[3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]

// => [-5,-4,-2,1,2,3]

// =>since we know we have equal no of +ve and -ve numbers

//so we strt from middle and swap 

// and we swap [-5,1 , -4,2 , -2,3]

//but here we need to preserve the order


//[3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]

//so we need to find one odd and one even number
