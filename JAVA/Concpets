 finalize() method

 Access modifiers, package

 try-catch-finally, multiple blocks

 transient keyword, passing sensitive info

 super keyword, calling parent methods

 Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions

 Generics → type safety

 Multilevel / Multiple inheritance → interfaces & default methods

 default and static methods in interfaces

 volatile keyword

 synchronized → method vs block, locks, ReentrantLock

 Garbage Collection → soft references, memory leaks

 Threads → lifecycle, creating threads, run() vs start(), thread safety

 fail-fast vs fail-safe iterators

2. Collections Framework

 Set → HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet

 Queue → PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque

 Map → HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable, ConcurrentHashMap

 Red-Black Tree → TreeMap, TreeSet

 Dynamic Arrays → ArrayList internal working

3. Multithreading / Concurrency

 Thread class, Runnable

 Thread lifecycle

 Synchronization → methods, blocks, Locks

 ReentrantLock / tryLock / fairness / Conditions

 volatile vs synchronized

 Deadlocks → detection & prevention strategies

 ThreadPool & ExecutorService → practical usage

 Concurrent Collections (briefly touched)

4. Other commonly asked topics

 String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder → differences

 Immutable objects

 hashCode() and equals() → importance in HashMap/HashSet
